## Background

The following report presents the results of the analysis of 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth. The animals were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

## Study Results


## Detailed Analysis

### Data Quality
The 1893 test data points received were checked for quality. Mice with ID g989 was found to have duplicate measurements at the same time points. The 5 data points presented in the table below were discarded. 1888 test data points represent the clean dataset.

### Summary Statistics
The following table presents the statistics of the tumor volume in mm3 for each regimen.

### Bar Plots
The following bar plot presents the number of mice per time point for each treatment.
It is noted that the number of mice reduces as the days pass. One assumption is that mice do not survive the tumor. The treatment of study Capomulin maintains the number of mice high accross the study, followed by Ramicane. The other treatments have count mice redutcion along the study.

### Pie Plots
The distribution by gender of the mice in the study is equivalent. Half of the mice are female and the other half are males.
